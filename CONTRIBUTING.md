# Dataset Contribution Guide  

Thank you for contributing to the **Plant Diseases Dataset Archive (PDDA)**! Follow these simple steps to contribute your data via our platform. You can upload datasets for **image classification** or **object detection (IOD)** and annotate them directly on the website.

## üñºÔ∏è How to Contribute  

1. **Visit the PDDA Platform**  
   Open our website at [www.pddaproject.org](#) and log in to your account. If you don‚Äôt have an account, register for free.  

2. **Select Data Type**  
   Choose the type of dataset you want to contribute:  
   - **Classification**: Images with a single label (e.g., "Healthy" or "Leaf Spot").  
   - **Object Detection (IOD)**: Images with multiple objects and bounding box annotations (e.g., identifying diseased and healthy areas in a single image).  

3. **Upload Your Images**  
   - Drag and drop your images into the uploader or select files from your device.  
   - Ensure images are clear and meet the platform's requirements:  
     - Minimum resolution: 224x224 pixels.  
     - Formats: JPG or PNG.  

4. **Annotate the Data**  
   - For **Classification**: Assign a label to each image by selecting the appropriate class from the dropdown menu (e.g., "Healthy," "Blight").  
   - For **Object Detection (IOD)**: Use the annotation tool to draw bounding boxes around diseased or healthy areas and assign labels to each bounding box.  

5. **Review and Save**  
   - Double-check your annotations for accuracy.  
   - Click **Save** to upload your dataset and annotations to the archive.

## üìù Contribution Guidelines  

- **Image Quality**:  
  - Ensure images are clear, well-lit, and free from excessive noise or blur.  
  - Avoid duplicate or irrelevant images.  

- **Annotation Quality**:  
  - For **Classification**: Assign only one label per image.  
  - For **Object Detection**: Ensure bounding boxes are tightly cropped around the area of interest and correctly labeled.  

- **Metadata**:  
  During the upload process, you‚Äôll be asked to provide metadata, such as:  
  - Plant species.  
  - Disease name.  
  - Optional details (e.g., location or method of data collection).
