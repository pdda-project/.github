# 🌱 PDDA Project

**Plant Diseases Dataset Archive (PDDA)** is an open platform dedicated to collecting, curating, and sharing a centralized dataset of plant disease images. Our goal is to create a comprehensive and easily accessible resource that empowers developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to contribute to and utilize a robust dataset for advancing agricultural technology.

## 🚀 About the Project

Agriculture plays a critical role in ensuring food security, and early detection of plant diseases is a key component of sustainable farming. The **PDDA Project** aims to bridge the gap between technology and agriculture by providing high-quality datasets that can be used to develop machine learning models for diagnosing plant diseases.

Whether you're an experienced machine learning developer or a curious learner, PDDA offers a platform for collaboration and innovation to help farmers identify and mitigate plant diseases effectively.
